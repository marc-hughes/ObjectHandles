***** VERSION 2

This is a Version 2 release of ObjectHandles.  It was a rewrite from scratch with a completely different API.  If
you're upgrading from a 1.0 release, you may want to look for a download with a "1.0" version number such as: 
ObjectHandles-1.0.0015-src.zip   	 

Most of the examples and instructions on the website are still targetting version 1

***** SWCs

The easiest way to get started is to grab the appropriate .swc from the the deploy folder, copy that to the
libs folder of your project, and start using the classes.

***** Examples

Examples can be found in 
  ObjectHandles2Example.mxml  (A comprehensive set of examples)
  ObjectHandlesFlex4Example.mxml  (A specialized example showing how to use ObjectHandles in Flex 4)
Other example classes are in: com.roguedevelopment.objecthandles.examples

****** OTHER SOFTWARE

For one of our examples, we use the Degrafa library which is also licensed under the MIT license.  You can
read more about that here: http://degrafa.org/

We include the Degrafa library in our libs folder to make building the example easier. You don't not need to
include this in your project unless you plan on using Degrafa as well.
